Better Multiplayer introduces a pseudo-hardcore mode in which players have only three lives before they are permanently banned. A life is counted as lost when the player dies and drops their items/xp, meaning keepinventory deaths do not count, and non player-caused deaths when using mods like Better Keepinventory don't either. Lives can be restored by an operator using life set [Player] [Number], or by using Phoenix Ash, which can be found in certain chests rarely (note that the player must still be alive to use Phoenix Ash, and you cannot go above 3 lives with Phoenix Ash).
